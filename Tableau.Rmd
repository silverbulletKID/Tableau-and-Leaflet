#Tableau

>What is Tableau

Tableau is a powerful softare that is intuitive and helps visualize complex datasets with ease without writing any code. If you wish to analyze your data geographically, Tableau is a clear choice since it is easy to use and can clearly highlight trends or patterns in your data

>Installation

Tableau can be used online or a desktop version can be downloaded and used within the trial period.

>Basic Example

In this example we used the city level data from https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities 
This dataset consists of all US cities, their population, their coordinates and a few other fields.

For building a basic map, one needs to add longitudes as columns and latitudes as rows from Measures.

Once a basic map is built we can start visualizing patterns by adding Marks. The map shows below has the following Marks:

- Detail: State Name

- Size: Population

We can also color states by population by adding the population Measure to Marks, as shown below -

> Proportional symbol maps

If one wants to visualize quantitative data proportional symbol maps are a good choice. 
We use the Earthquake dataset included in Create Proportional Symbol Maps in Tableau Example Workbook on Tableau Public. The steps for building a proportional symbols map are as follows:

- Columns: Longitude, Rows: Latitude

Add following Marks:
- Detail: ID (from Dimensions), Size: Magnitude^10 (from Measures).

This gives the following basic proportional symbol map. The larger data points represent earthquakes with larger magnitudes, and the smaller data points represent earthquakes with smaller magnitudes.

_________________________


You can play around with Marks to add Color (it is also possible to change color in Edit Colors dialog box). The following plot was generated from experimenting with the workbook on Tableau Public -  https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/maps_howto_symbol.htm 

It shows dark orange data points which represent earthquakes with higher magnitudes, while the dark blue data points represent earthquakes with lower magnitudes.

> Heatmaps

Another way we can visualize the city dataset is by using heatmaps to show concentrations of cities in the US. This can be done easily by changing the Marks setting from Automatic to Density which will generate a heatmap. The following plot shows the heatmap of cities in the US. The darker portions represent a higher density of cities and vice versa for lighter portions.

Tableau can be used to build Flow Maps, Spider Maps, Point distribution maps and many other types of visualizations. The type of map used depends on the dataset.

Although Tableau can be used without any coding experience, if one wants to integrate Python or R with Tableau, they have the option to do so. Instructions and examples on how to do so can be found on the following links:
